/*Well ,I actually facing a problem in my code.As far as my knowledge any globally declared variable or node after going through a while or an other loop will retain its value even outside the loop.But somehow 
 here my head pointer is not retaining the value once outside the loop.I tried whatever I could but I have no idea where I went wrong.*/
